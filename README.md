# Alexander Eble's JSON Resume [![gist-sync](https://github.com/alexanderdavide/json-resume/actions/workflows/gist-sync.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alexanderdavide/json-resume/actions/workflows/gist-sync.yml) [![website status](https://img.shields.io/website?down_color=red&up_color=success&url=https%3A%2F%2Fregistry.jsonresume.org/alexanderdavide)](https://img.shields.io/website?down_color=red&style=for-the-badge&up_color=green&url=https%3A%2F%2Fregistry.jsonresume.org/alexanderdavide)

- Made using the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard and [jsonresume-theme-paper](https://github.com/TimDaub/jsonresume-theme-paper).
- I use [gist-sync-action](https://github.com/Popsiclestick/gist-sync-action) to continuously publish a `resume.json` as gist.
- The [`resume.json`](https://gist.github.com/alexanderdavide/9a6c025553cc25001eed4e8d404cf73c) gist is automatically picked up by [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) and hosted on their [registry](https://registry.jsonresume.org/alexanderdavide).
